# MacMalwareRemoval
Tool to quickly remove common mac malware


# NOTE: This tool has not been maintained since April 2016.


Currently, the tool will scan through the system applications, system library, root library, and the user folder based on the search terms provided.

NOTE: The script must be run with sudo in front of it and for best results, ran in safe mode on a mac.
After the tool runs, you will have to manually reset up the home page and verify the problematic extentions in all of the browsers on the computer. Then perform a restart to reload the changes that were made back into regular boot and test out the results.
